**Renegades vs Luminosity**

I don't know whats happening with RNG but they are just simply GODS recently. They beat SK and Liquid easily and have continued that form with wins over SPLYCE and Selfless.
Their lineup si really talented and have lots of experience and I am definitely favouring them over LG.

Luminosity's lineup is also pretty talented. They have SHOWTIME and nak who are both pretty good players. They have also had success against top teams with good results over Echo Fox and Selfless.
However I don't think they are able to beat a RNG side that is on fire and has never been better. 

**My Bet: 3-4% on RNG**
