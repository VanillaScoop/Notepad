**Kinda busy today so I will be very quick and brief!**

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dignitas vs GODSENT**

Ok fact is that Dignitas is capable of winning the BO1. They have taken a map off nearly every team they have playe with recently and their lineup is pretty strong too. 
GODSENT of course the favoured team but we have seen that this 'all-star' lineup is not invicible. 

**My Bet: 1% on Dignitas**

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**NAVI vs Tyloo**

This is going to be an easy choice for me. Tyloo is getting underestimated here. They are the best Asian team out there and they have shown before that they are more than capable of playing Tier 1 European teams. 
I have to admit that NAVI's lineup looks really strong with the addition of simple and they have had extremely good results to match. However Tyloo are getting +6 odds on FANOBET which I believe is extremely unaccurate. I am going for the safer approach here. I am not entirely sure how Tyloo are going to perform but they should be able to pull of 9 rounds.

**My Bet: 1-2% on Tyloo to get at least 8.5 rounds**
**If not possible then consider a small bet on Tyloo**
