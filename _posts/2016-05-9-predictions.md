Had a good day yesterday. Hope we can do the same for today!

**ANOX vs HellRaisers**

This looks pretty straight forward to me. HR are just the better team with the better lineup and gameplay. They have been performing really well lately too with wins over Epsilon, Tricked and Fnatic.
While ANOX is semi-decent, they aren't just good enough to play against HR. 

**My Bet: 10% on HR**

Result: HR 2-1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**GODSENT vs Mousesports**

This is going to be a good game. Both teams are really good but I personally would favour GODSENT slightly just because of their incredible lineup. However mousesports with 2.99 odds on FANOBET and 1.60 odds for them to win at least one map is pretty insane. I am pretty sure that mousesports can win their own map pick, they are pretty strong on maps like Dust 2 and Cache but for the whole BO3 I am not really sure. We didn't get much out of GODSENT in their 1-2 loss against FaZe recently. They did perform like crap on Train and Dust 2 which are both maps which mousesports could potentially beat them on. 

I did say before that GODSENT should be favoured but I also say that they are overhyped. Mouse as a underdog team is always a great bet but I personally am going to go for a safer option which is for mousesports to win at least one map

**My Bet: 1-2% on Mousesports to win at least one map**

Result: GODSENT 2-1
