Had a good day yesterday. Hope we can do the same for today!

**ANOX vs HellRaisers**

This looks pretty straight forward to me. HR are just the better team with the better lineup and gameplay. They have been performing really well lately too with wins over Epsilon, Tricked and Fnatic.
While ANOX is semi-decent, they aren't just good enough to play against HR. 

**My Bet: 10% on HR**

**GODSENT vs Mousesports**

COMING SOON
