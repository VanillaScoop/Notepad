Going well these past two days. 3/3 bets. LETS CONTINUE THIS MONEY MAKING STREAK!


**PENTA vs FaZe**
Map: Cache

PENTA if they are playing with their current lineup on HLTV is a side to be reckoned with. Their old side with kairi frankly didn't get good results but this lastest side does have potential. I still think this side is a tad inconsistent at time but they have gotten results, with a BO1 win over VP a couple weeks back.
Frankly I think Cache is one of PENTA's best maps. They have got consistent game results on Cache so far with a near win against MK and a overtime loss against BLUEJAYS and win over Spirit on Cache.

Cache for FaZe is a differently story. They have got mixed results on this map but it is to be noticed that they are playing against much better teams and this could be the reason why. But its safe to say that this is one of the worser maps.
However what FaZe lacks for their gameplay on Cache, they make up in individual skill. Individually, I would say FaZe's players are much better but PENTA has had a history of winning as underdog.

**My Bet: 1% on PENTA**

**Preparation vs SPIRIT**

SPIRIT was one of my favourite teams to bet on. They used to be extremely consistent and a safe choice when betting. However they aren't playing that well lately with losses just building up. I guess you could justify that because they are playing teams their level or higher BUT Spirit at its peak a couple months back were destroying overdogs left, right and centre. Now they just love or have games too close for comfort or just get destroyed. However it isn't good to underestimate them and I have seen times when they just randomly start winning. I would personally favour them over Preparation but the circumstances have changed a little.

Preparation is a pretty decent team. They have had mixed results lately. This is going to be short but the bottom line is that I think Preparation has what it takes here to upset Spirit. Alright that might not be very likely but they definitely have a chance to take one map at least. They managed to take a map off PENTA which SPIRIT coudln't even get 5 rounds off so performance wise, Preparation has been doing better. 

**My Bet: 1-2% on Preparation to win at least one map**
