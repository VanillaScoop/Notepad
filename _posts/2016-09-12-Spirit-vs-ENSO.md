Only going to be one prediction tonight. Swamped with assignments and work :(

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**Spirit vs ENSO**

This is looking pretty straightforward. SPIRIT is definitely the better team by far in terms of skill, teamwork and gameplay. Spirit did look a bit shaky a few games back but now they look kinda back to normal...
ENSO is an alrightish team but if they can't win against teams their own tier and level, then theres definitely no chance of them beating SPIRIT.

However SPIRIT does have insanely crap odds and they are an inconsistent team so if you don't WANT TO RISK IT THEN DON'T BET.

**My Bet: 10% on Spirit**
