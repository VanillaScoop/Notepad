**Dignitas vs Gambit**

This is probably the most risky bet in terms of possible profit I am going to take tonight. I want to bet on Dignitas because they are in better form and have better players. Dignitas has taken a map off Astralis and VP + won against TENGRI (which Gambit couldn't manage) and they beat HR.  But then I remember Gambit as a team that decides to wreck on LAN. But then I think to myself is Gambit even capable this time? They lost to TENGRI 0-2 and didn't even come close against Mousesports. Sure they have good players on LAN but right now they aren't worth betting on. 

**My Bet: 3-4% on Dignitas**


-------------------------------------------------------------------
**NAVI vs Astralis**

Simple bet to make here. Astralis getting 3.00 odds on FANOBET is just ridiculous. They have been playing well recently and they had a pretty close game against Heroic. Like NAVI isn't invicible as seen in their loss against Tyloo yesterday.
Basically no Tier 1 team should be getting 3.00 odds on a BO1

**My Bet:1% on Astralis**


-------------------------------------------------------------------
**VP vs VG.CyberZen**

As seen with Tyloo and NAVI yesterday, top Asian teams really do have a chance against European ones. I consider CyberZen to be second best in Asia after Tyloo and they really have potential to beat VP in a BO1. The Chinese team performs well as a team and has a lot of individual firepower as well. 

I would obviously favour VP but 1.14 odds in a BO1? VP aren't unbeatable and they have lost BO1s to Dig and PENTA recently so CyberZen really has a chance.

**My Bet: 1% on CyberZen**
