**Dignitas vs Gambit**

Coming soon!




-------------------------------------------------------------------
**NAVI vs Astralis**

Simple bet to make here. Astralis getting 3.00 odds on FANOBET is just ridiculous. They have been playing well recently and they had a pretty close game against Heroic. Like NAVI isn't invicible as seen in their loss against Tyloo yesterday.
Basically no Tier 1 team should be getting 3.00 odds on a BO1

**My Bet:1% on Astralis**

More coming right up!
