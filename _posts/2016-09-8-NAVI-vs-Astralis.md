**Dignitas vs Gambit**






-------------------------------------------------------------------
**NAVI vs Astralis**

Simple bet to make here. Astralis getting 3.00 odds on FANOBET is just ridiculous. They have been playing well recently and they had a pretty close game against Heroic. Like NAVI isn't invicible as seen in their loss against Tyloo yesterday.
Basically no Tier 1 team should be getting 3.00 odds on a BO1

**My Bet:1% on Astralis**


-------------------------------------------------------------------
**VP vs VG.CyberZen**

As seen with Tyloo and NAVI yesterday, top Asian teams really do have a chance against European ones. I consider CyberZen to be second best in Asia after Tyloo and they really have potential to beat VP in a BO1. The Chinese team performs well as a team and has a lot of individual firepower as well. 

I would obviously favour VP but 1.14 odds in a BO1? VP aren't unbeatable and they have lost BO1s to Dig and PENTA recently so CyberZen really has a chance.

**My Bet: 1% on CyberZen**
