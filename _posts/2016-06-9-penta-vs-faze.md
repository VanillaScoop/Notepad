Going well these past two days. 3/3 bets. LETS CONTINUE THIS MONEY MAKING STREAK!


**PENTA vs FaZe**
Map: Cache

PENTA if they are playing with their current lineup on HLTV is a side to be reckoned with. Their old side with kairi frankly didn't get good results but this lastest side does have potential. I still think this side is a tad inconsistent at time but they have gotten results, with a BO1 win over VP a couple weeks back.
Frankly I think Cache is one of PENTA's best maps. They have got consistent game results on Cache so far with a near win against MK and a overtime loss against BLUEJAYS and win over Spirit on Cache.

Cache for FaZe is a differently story. They have got mixed results on this map but it is to be noticed that they are playing against much better teams and this could be the reason why. But its safe to say that this is one of the worser maps.
However what FaZe lacks for their gameplay on Cache, they make up in individual skill. Individually, I would say FaZe's players are much better but PENTA has had a history of winning as underdog hence our bet

**My Bet: 1% on PENTA**
