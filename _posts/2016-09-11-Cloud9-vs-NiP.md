**Cloud 9 vs NiP**

This is going to be a hard one. Both teams are performing exceptionally well and its really hard to say who will win here. Lets look at it from a numbers perspective. I reckon this game should be around 45-55 or 50-50 but the odds on FANOBET are 2.33 for Cloud 9 and 1.56 for NiP. Logically we should go for the Cloud 9 bet right? But I am torn between deciding who to bet on here. I personally think that both teams will win a map and it will go to the decider. 

I don't know much about map picks but one map which NiP have played a lot recently and have success on is Cache. However that will most likely be banned by Cloud 9. 

Again both teams have been playing exceptionally well and the teams are pretty even in my opinion. But I think I am going with Cloud 9. As I said before this game is pretty close to call and with Cloud 9 being underdog by a fair amount here, this is a good bet.
I know I have been insistent on underdog bets recently but they are working and no overdog team is guaranteed a win. 
Cloud 9 have exceptionally players like stewie who have an enormous amount of talent and they are capable of beating NiP.

**My Bet: 2% on Cloud 9**

**You could go for the option for over 2.5 maps here but this stuff is pretty risky, like NiP or Cloud 9 could win 2-0**
