**Dignitas vs GODSENT**

Ok fact is that Dignitas is capable of winning the BO1. They have taken a map off nearly every team they have playe with recently and their lineup is pretty strong too. 
GODSENT of course the favoured team but we have seen that this 'all-star' lineup is not invicible. 

**My Bet: 1% on Dignitas**
